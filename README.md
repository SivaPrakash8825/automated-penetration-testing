# Automated Penetration Testing
### Overview
Automated Penetration Testing is a web application designed to streamline the process of identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications. Customers can submit the URL of their web application, and upon validation, the system conducts automated penetration testing using command-line interface (CLI) commands of Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) and Nmap tools.

The application generates comprehensive reports for customers to download, providing detailed insights into potential vulnerabilities discovered during the testing process. By automating these security assessments, Automated Penetration Testing empowers customers to proactively identify and address security weaknesses in their web applications, ultimately enhancing their overall cybersecurity posture.
